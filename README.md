# Data-Representation-and-Querying

### Scott Coyne - G00316578

## Introduction
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Playgrounds County Galway" which is Available at [https://data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/data)

The above dataset will be used to provied information about local playgrounds located in the County Galway area. Which could be implemented into an App or Website to provied the Location, Closing times, Amenities, Pictures of the playgound etc. 

Given this information, this API would be able to show Real Time information about each playground. And would provide Parents/children and playground entuisests concreate information and pictures of the playgrounds, without having to drive to leave the house.

This Api could also be implemented accross serveral other counties, with a similar dataset.
